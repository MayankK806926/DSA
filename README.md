Here, I'm adding some of the special and good level problems which were either difficult for me or attracted me for the logic used in the problem statement.

Some more things:

-> The digital root of a non-negative integer is the single digit value obtained by an iterative process of summing digits, on each iteration using the result from the previous iteration to compute a digit sum. The process continues until a single-digit number is reached.

-> To handle the case of odd and even(int and float):
 int k=n/2+n%2;
